# Components

Try to not overload components, use your customHooks to work with businessLogic.
Tip: I would not consider Pagination as business logic but try to build a customHook around this logic.

# Design

I will grade this project as 80% Design/Markup/Styles implementation and 20% React/JS.

There's a lot of inspiration in the internet about a Pokedex and Pagination so there's no excuse about it.
