# PokeDex with React!!!
Welcome to this project, this is an app made entirely in React and gets its resources from the PokeApi. It shows 9 pokemons in the same page with the next information:

 - Order  
 - Name  
 - Height  
 - Generation when it was introduced  
 - Types 
 - Image

The app has an Input element that acts as a search bar that can take numbers or strings and the Grid of Pokemons needs to change to reflect the results.

The app implements a dropdown element with all the types of pokemons as options and whenever a type is selected the Grid of Pokemons needs to change to reflect the results.

The Grid of Pokemons includes a Pagination component that will allow the user to sort throught all the possible results, the page size must be always 9. 

The page is responsive. While it shows a grid of 3x3 in the desktop version,  mobile version only will show a single column
